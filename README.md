Code for paper: "Using Electronic Health Records and Machine Learning to Make Medical-Related Predictions from Non-Medical Data"

In this repository lies the code used for the experiments published in the paper:
Pitoglou, S., Koumpouros, Y., & Anastasiou, A. (2019). Using Electronic Health Records and Machine Learning to Make Medical-Related Predictions from Non-Medical Data. 2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Engineering (ICMLDE), 56â€“60. Retrieved from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614004/

The original data files were omitted, for obvious reasons, and the intermediate dataset (in "data.csv") is used instead.

## Notebook Installation

### Anaconda

Anaconda is a free distribution of the Python programming language for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

Follow instructions to install [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) or the more lightweight [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).
